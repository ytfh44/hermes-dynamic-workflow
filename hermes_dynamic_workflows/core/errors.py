"""Workflow-specific exceptions.

Two families, split on purpose:

* ``DynamicWorkflowError`` (→ ``Exception``): recoverable. A workflow script may
  ``try/except Exception`` around these (e.g. a child agent that failed, a
  nested workflow error, bad indexing of results) and handle them gracefully.
* ``WorkflowHalt`` (→ ``BaseException``): run-level halts — user stop, the
  workflow deadline, and hard limits (token budget / agent cap / loop cap).
  These derive from ``BaseException`` so a script's ``except Exception`` cannot
  swallow them; the run stays cancellable and bounded no matter what the script
  catches. The sandbox additionally forbids bare ``except:`` / ``except
  BaseException`` so they cannot be caught by a wildcard either.
