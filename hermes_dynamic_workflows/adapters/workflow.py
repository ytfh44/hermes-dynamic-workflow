    'Execute a workflow script that orchestrates multiple subagents deterministically. Workflows run in the background — this tool returns immediately with a task ID, and a <task-notification> arrives when the workflow completes. Use /workflows to watch live progress.\n'
    '\n'
    "A workflow structures work across many agents — to be comprehensive (decompose and cover in parallel), to be confident (independent perspectives and adversarial checks before committing), or to take on scale one context can't hold (migrations, audits, broad sweeps). The script is where you encode that structure: what fans out, what verifies, what synthesizes.\n"
    '\n'
    'ONLY call this tool when the user has explicitly opted into multi-agent orchestration. Workflows can spawn dozens of agents and consume a large amount of tokens; the user must request that scale, not have it inferred. Explicit opt-in means one of:\n'
    '- The user directly asked you to run a workflow or use multi-agent orchestration in their own words ("use a workflow", "run a workflow", "fan out agents", "orchestrate this with subagents"). The ask must be in the user\'s words — a task that would merely benefit from a workflow does not count.\n'
    '- The user invoked a skill or slash command whose instructions tell you to call the workflow tool.\n'
    '- The user asked you to run a specific named or saved workflow.\n'
    '\n'
    'For any other task — even one that would clearly benefit from parallelism — do NOT call this tool. Use the available tools, or briefly describe what a multi-agent workflow could do and how much it would roughly cost, and ask the user whether to run it. Mention they can ask for one with "use a workflow" in a future message to skip the ask.\n'
    '\n'
    "When you do call it, the right move is often **hybrid**: scout inline first (list the files, find the channels, scope the diff) to discover the work-list, then call Workflow to pipeline over it. You don't need to know the shape before the *task* — only before the *orchestration step*.\n"
    '\n'
    'Common single-phase workflows you can chain across turns:\n'
    '- **Understand** — parallel readers over relevant subsystems → structured map\n'
    '- **Design** — judge panel of N independent approaches → scored synthesis\n'
    '- **Review** — dimensions → find → adversarially verify (example below)\n'
    '- **Research** — multi-modal sweep → deep-read → synthesize\n'
    '- **Migrate** — discover sites → transform each (worktree isolation) → verify\n'
    '\n'
    'For larger work, run several in sequence — read each result before deciding the next phase. You stay in the loop; each workflow is one well-scoped fan-out.\n'
    '\n'
    'Pass the script inline via `script` — do not save it to a file first. Every invocation automatically persists its script to a file under the session directory and returns the path in the tool result. To iterate on a workflow, edit that file and re-invoke the workflow tool with `{scriptPath: "<path>"}` instead of resending the full script.\n'

Optional: `whenToUse` (shown in the workflow list), `phases`. Use the SAME phase titles in meta["phases"] as in phase() calls — titles are matched exactly; a phase() call with no matching meta entry just gets its own progress group. Add `model` to a phase entry when that phase uses a specific model override.\n'
    '\n'
    'Script body hooks:\n'
    '- agent(prompt: str, opts: dict | None = None) -> Awaitable[Any] — spawn a subagent. Use `await agent(...)` for direct calls. Inside parallel()/pipeline() callbacks, return the awaitable; the helper will await it. Supported opts are `label`, `phase`, `schema`, `model`, `isolation`, and `agentType`. Without schema, returns its final text as a string. With schema (a JSON Schema), the subagent is forced to call the `structured_output` tool and agent() returns the validated object — no parsing needed. Returns None if the user skips the agent mid-run (filter with `if x is not None`). opts["label"] overrides the display label. opts["phase"] explicitly assigns this agent to a progress group (use this inside pipeline()/parallel() stages to avoid races on the global phase() state — same phase string → same group box). opts["model"] overrides the model for this agent call. Default to omitting it — the agent inherits the resolved session model, which is almost always correct. Only set it when you\'re highly confident a different tier fits the task; when unsure, omit. opts["isolation"]: "worktree" runs the agent in a fresh git worktree — EXPENSIVE (~200-500ms setup + disk per agent), use ONLY when agents mutate files in parallel and would otherwise conflict; the worktree is auto-removed if unchanged. opts["agentType"] uses a custom subagent type (e.g. "explore", "verification") instead of the default workflow subagent(general-purpose) — resolved from workflow agent files; composes with schema (the custom agent\'s system prompt gets a structured_output instruction appended).\n'
    '- pipeline(items, stage1, stage2, ...) -> Awaitable[list[Any]] — run each item through all stages independently, NO barrier between stages. Call it with `await`. Item A can be in stage 3 while item B is still in stage 1. This is the DEFAULT for multi-stage work. Wall-clock = slowest single-item chain, not sum-of-slowest-per-stage. Every stage callback receives (prev_result, original_item, index) — use original_item/index in later stages to label work without threading context through stage 1\'s return value. A stage that raises drops that item to `None` and skips its remaining stages.\n'
    '- parallel(thunks: list[Callable[[], Awaitable[Any] | Any]]) -> Awaitable[list[Any]] — run tasks concurrently. Call it with `await`. This is a BARRIER: awaits all thunks before returning. A thunk that raises (or whose agent errors) resolves to `None` in the result list — the call itself never raises for per-item failures, so filter out `None` values before using the results. Use ONLY when you genuinely need all results together.\n'
    '- map(items, thunk) -> Awaitable[list[Any]] — fan a thunk out over a runtime collection and collect results in input order. Call it with `await`. `thunk(item, index)` usually returns `await agent(...)` (or `gate(...)`) but may return any value. Same barrier/failure semantics as `parallel()`: a failing item resolves to `None`, the rest keep running, and the list is ordered by input position, not completion. Use this when the work-list is only known at runtime (e.g. results of an earlier agent) — for a fixed set of thunks written in the script, use `parallel()` directly.\n'
    '- gate(prompt: str, opts: dict | None = None) -> Awaitable[Any] — run a child agent and block its result unless it passes a quality gate. Call it with `await`. Same opts as `agent()` plus two gate-only keys: `check` — a zero-token, pure-data check that costs no LLM tokens: `{"contains": "..."}`, `{"not_contains": "..."}`, `{"regex": "..."}`, or `{"field": "k", "equals": v}` (field works on structured-output dicts). A failing check raises GateBlocked immediately, before any judge runs. `judge: True` — an LLM judge: re-runs the prompt as a fresh child with a structured verdict schema ({\"verdict\": \"PASS\"|\"BLOCK\", \"reason\": str}); anything other than PASS (including an unparseable or failed judge run) raises GateBlocked (fail-closed). GateBlocked is a recoverable exception — wrap `gate()` in try/except Exception to degrade gracefully. Judge verdicts are cached, so repeated identical gate() calls reuse the verdict instead of re-spending tokens; cached child results are still re-checked zero-token on resume. Use gates to enforce quality contracts — e.g. require a report to mention specific findings, or have an adversarial judge double-check a result before you trust it.\n'
    '- log(message: str) -> None — emit a progress message to the user (shown as a narrator line above the progress tree)\n'
    '- phase(title: str) -> None — start a new phase; subsequent agent() calls are grouped under this title in the progress display\n'
    '- args: Any — the value passed as Workflow\'s `args` input, verbatim (`None` if not provided). Pass arrays/objects as actual JSON values in the tool call, NOT as a JSON-encoded string — `args: ["a.ts", "b.ts"]`, not `args: "[\\"a.ts\\", ...]"` (a stringified list reaches the script as one string, so list/dict operations you expected may fail). Use this to parameterize named workflows — e.g. pass a research question, target path, or config object directly instead of via a side-channel file.\n'
    '- budget: object with `total`, `spent()`, and `remaining()` — the token target parsed from the user\'s "+500k"-style directive for this workflow run. `budget.total` is `None` if no target was set. `budget.spent()` returns child-agent tokens spent by this workflow run. `budget.remaining()` returns `max(0, total - spent())`, or `math.inf` if no target. The target is a HARD ceiling, not advisory: once `spent()` reaches `total`, further agent() calls raise. Use for dynamic loops: `while budget.total and budget.remaining() > 50_000: ...`, or static scaling: `fleet = int(budget.total / 100_000) if budget.total else 5`.\n'
    '- workflow(name_or_ref: str | {"scriptPath": str}, args: Any = None) -> Awaitable[Any] — run another workflow inline as a sub-step and return whatever it returns. Call it with `await`. Pass a name to invoke a saved workflow (same registry as `{name: "..."}`), or `{"scriptPath": path}` to run a script file you wrote earlier. The child shares this run\'s concurrency cap, agent counter, abort signal, and token budget. The args param becomes the child\'s `args` global. Nesting is one level only: workflow() inside a child raises. Raises on unknown name / unreadable scriptPath / child syntax error; catch Exception to handle gracefully.\n'
    '\n'
    'Subagents are told their final text IS the return value (not a human-facing message), so they return raw data. For structured output, use the schema option — validation happens at the tool-call layer so the model retries on mismatch.\n'
    '\n'
    'Workflow agents can reach all session-connected MCP tools when `tool_search` is enabled — schemas load on demand per agent. Caveat: interactively-authenticated MCP servers may be absent in headless/cron runs.\n'
    '\n'
    'Scripts are restricted plain Python. The script body runs in an async context — use `await` directly. Available globals are intentionally narrow: `agent`, `parallel`, `pipeline`, `phase`, `log`, `args`, `budget`, `workflow`, `json`, `math`, safe built-ins, and common exception types. Imports, filesystem/process/network APIs, dunder traversal, dynamic eval/exec, class definitions, and dynamic call targets are rejected. Current time and randomness APIs are unavailable because they would break resume; pass timestamps in via `args`, stamp results after the workflow returns, and for randomness vary the agent prompt/label by index.\n'
    '\n'
    'DEFAULT TO pipeline(). Only reach for a barrier (parallel between stages) when you genuinely need ALL prior-stage results together.\n'
    '\n'
    'A barrier is correct ONLY when stage N needs cross-item context from all of stage N-1:\n'
    '- Dedup/merge across the full result set before expensive downstream work\n'
    '- Early-exit if the total count is zero ("0 bugs found → skip verification entirely")\n'
    '- Stage N\'s prompt references "the other findings" for comparison\n'
    '\n'
    'A barrier is NOT justified by:\n'
    '- "I need to flatten/map/filter first" — do it inside a pipeline stage\n'

    '  c = await parallel([...])\n'
    "that middle transform doesn't need the barrier. Rewrite as a pipeline with the transform inside a stage. When in doubt: pipeline.\n"
    '\n'
    "Concurrent agent() calls are capped at min(16, cpu cores - 2) per workflow — excess calls queue and run as slots free up. You can still pass 100 items to parallel()/pipeline() and they all complete; only ~10 run at any moment. Total agent count across a workflow's lifetime is capped at 1000 — a runaway-loop backstop set far above any real workflow.\n"
